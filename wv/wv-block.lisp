;; Coding guide to myself:

;; 1) When I need to check if flag (bit) is set, use bit-set-p function
;; 2) When I need to choose which flag in the set is set, use cond
;;    macro with (logand x mask)
;; 3) When I need to get a value from flags using masks and shifts, use
;;    automatically generated special functions
