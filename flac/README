A sketch for flac decoder.

Features:
* Reads metadata from flac stream (not all metadata types is supported currently).
  Also it can skip unparseable data.

* Reads and decodes audio frames.

* Can seek sample in stream by absolute sample number (with or without seektable)

Frame and streaminfo data can be found in corresponding classes

Unfortunately, there is no documentation present, but you can see simple flac 2 wav converter in cl-flac-examples.
 Example of use:

(asdf:load-system :cl-flac-examples)
(flac-examples:flac2wav "file.flac" "file.wav")

It is about 5 times slower than original flac decoder written on C.
Not tested with 32 bit architectures.
