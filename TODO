1. The low-level bitreader definitely is a bottleneck and have big 
   potential for optimizations.

2. There is no good "container" abstraction. For FLAC we do not need one
   (just bit reader -> frame reader -> decoder is enough), but for ogg we
   need a facility which allows transparent work with logical bitstreams.
   Maybe use of CLOS (building containers atop of bitreader class) is
   justified here.
