1. Bitreader is very slow. Make universal bitreader to read both to single
integer (i.e. for reading parameter) and to array (for reading samples) and
use it and only it. Add possibility to read with reserve (for big blocks of 
small-sized values).

2. (?) Do not pass whole objects such as frame or subframe if you need only
 one value from them.

3. Do not pass too many arguments to residual-reader

4. Do less array allocation/deallocation
