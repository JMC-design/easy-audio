A sketch for flac decoder.

Currently it can read flac metadata and parse streaminfo metadata block (use #'flac:open-flac).
Also it can read frames with #'flac:frame-reader and decode them with #'flac:frame-decode

Frame and streaminfo data can be found in corresponding classes

There is simple flac 2 wav converter in cl-flac-examples. Example of use:
(asdf:load-system :cl-flac-examples)
(flac-examples:flac2wav "file.flac" "file.wav")

It is about 5 times slower than original flac decoder written on C.
Not tested with 32 bit architectures.
